However, the term quality can have different interpretations depending on the person or company that is evaluating it, for that reason it is very important to have a standard for the requirements that the company wishes to meet. </span></p>\r\n\t\t<p><span style=\"font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:8pt;\">International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has created a set of standards and procedures (ISO 9000, ISO 9001) to represent an international consensus on good quality management practices.</span></p>\r\n\t\t<p><span style=\"font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:8pt;\">ISO9000 describes the fundamentals of a quality management system including the eight management principles. ISO 9001 deals with the requirements that organizations must meet to fulfill quality standards. </span></p>\r\n\t\t<p><span style=\"font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:8pt;\">A key point in a Quality Management System is the solution of nonconformities. A nonconformity is presented when a requirement is not fulfilled. Failing to correct a nonconformity or the continued presence of one, results in costs associated to re-work, replacement, loss of customers, and even the loss of quality certification, to name a few.</span></p>\r\n\t\t<p><span style=\"font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:8pt;\">Considering the development and efficiency of companies, bizagi offers a new process that helps to manage nonconformities in a quick and efficient manner.</span></p>\r\n\t\t<p><span style=\"font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:8pt;\">The Nonconformity Management template offers a fast and flexible tool that allows the person responsible for the solution of the nonconformity to easily allocate tasks, from the NC detention going through the root cause analysis and finishing with the elimination of the causes. </span></p>\r\n\t\t<p><span style=\"font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:8pt;\">The process provides the possibility to execute an immediate solution to correct the nonconformity in the short term. It is also possible to create a Corrective Action to attack the root cause of the problem and avoid future recurrences.</span></p>\r\n\t\t<p><span style=\"font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:8pt;\">Additionally, the template includes a small process that creates a Preventive Action in order to eliminate potential causes of nonconformities.</span></p>\r\n\t\t<p><span style=\"font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:8pt;\">Finally Bizagi offers the possibility to control and monitor the performance of the process, through indicators that can be created using Query Forms, bizagis tools like BAM and sensors. </span></p>","version":"1.0","author":"Bizagi Process Modeler","image":"files\\diagrams\\Nonconformity Management.svg","isSubprocessPage":false,"isCallActivityPage":false,"properties":[{"id":"c9d9f48e-d61e-416f-9cf3-01595bf70862","name":"Definitions","value":"<p><span style=\"font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:8pt;\">Nonconformity: A nonconformity is presented when a requirement is not fulfilled. </span></p>\n\t\t<p><span style=\"font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:8pt;\">Corrective Action: A procedure to eliminate the causes of a detected nonconformity. </span></p>\n\t\t<p><span style=\"font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:8pt;\">Preventive Action: A procedure to eliminate the causes of a potential nonconformity. </span></p>\n\t\t<p><span style=\"font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:8pt;\">QMS: Quality Management System is a group of activities and procedures to direct and control in an efficient and proactive manner the development of your business processes. </span></p>\n\t\t<p><span style=\"font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:8pt;\">Product: Throughout the document the word PRODUCT is used to indicate a product or service.</span></p>\n\t\t<p><span style=\"font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:8pt;\">Correction: To correct or to eliminate a nonconformity. </span></p>","type":"text","description":""},{"id":"114ec61e-1037-410b-ba4e-2b1c32ee8b8f","name":"Objectives","value":"<p><span style=\"font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:8pt;\">The process covers:</span></p>\n\t\t<p><span style=\"font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:8pt;\">Implementing an immediate solution for the nonconformity</span></p>\n\t\t<p><span style=\"font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:8pt;\">Performing a Corrective Action to eliminate the root causes of the Nonconformity. </span></p>\n\t\t<p><span style=\"font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:8pt;\">Executing a flexible Action Plan to assign responsibilities to different people. </span></p>\n\t\t<p><span style=\"font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:8pt;\">Performing a Preventive Action to eliminate the root causes of a potential Nonconformity.</span></p>","type":"text","description":""},{"id":"a4c8f8b2-5b00-4ab0-892b-ad4c8a582042","name":"Scope","value":"<p><span style=\"font-family:Segoe UI;font-size:8pt;\">Bizagi&#180;s Nonconformity Management Template is designed to correct and eliminate the root causes of nonconformities.
